# Options for JRuby for Max #

# To use:
# - Rename this file to jruby_for_max.properties
# - Put it on the Max file search path
# - Restart Max (and restart again each time you change this file)


ruby.loadpaths =
# A semicolon-separated list of absolute paths to append to the default $LOAD_PATH.
# You can use this to add gems or other projects installed elsewhere.
# Default value is nothing.


# jruby.home = /Users/adam/lib/jruby-1.5.5
# If you want to install a lot of gems: instead of adding a loadpath for each one, 
# you can install them into a separate jruby installation and set jruby.home to
# run against that jruby instead of the built-in one.
# This variable is not set by default.



ruby.initializers = jruby_initialize.rb
# A semicolon-separated list of files. 
# These files will be run in the order listed whenever a new jruby context is initialized.
# Default value is jruby_initialize.rb
